## 3 Ecosystems

By no means are these the only Ecosystems built on and expanding the technologies above. But these are a good place to start

### WIP

<!-- There are multiple different implementations for acheiving Decentralized Identity. Each are quite involved on their own.

TrustOverIP - https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/
Hyperledger Aires- https://www.edx.org/course/identity-in-hyperledger-aries-indy-and-ursa -->




<!-- Credential Exchange:
- DIF(PE)
- Hyperledger Aries
- W3C? -Credential Handler Api

Verifying Credentials:
- DID Document -->
