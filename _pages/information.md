# Hackathon Rules
- **Theme/Focus**: All things SSI related. See [Project Ideas](#project-ideas) for ideas if you're struggling to come up with something.

However, participants are encouraged to utilize publicly available libraries, frameworks, and APIs, including those provided by our esteemed sponsors.
- **Be Respectful**: You know what it means. If the organizers decide you are not following this simple rule, then we hold the right to remove you from the hackathon.

# Project Ideas:

Below are just a few prompts to get you thinking about the space and the problems within. Your projects do not have to satisfy these prompts.

## Start with Use Cases

- Browsing the internet feels anything but private these days due to constant surveillance, data breaches, and lack of control. How can decentralized identity be leveraged to ensure privacy and protect our identities when we‚Äôre interacting online?
- More than 1.1 billion people have no official, legally-recognized identity which prevents access to everything from basic services to banking, education, and more. How can decentralized identity technology empower these individuals?
- The metaverse enables new digital experiences that require new ways of using and sharing our digital identities. How can we leverage decentralized identity technology to enhance how we interact in the metaverse?


## Start with Features

- How would you create a new digital identity for the future that is shareable and private?
- What is the best way to render a Verifiable Credential in a product considering both technical requirements and user experience?
- How can biometrics be incorporated into the issuance and/or verification process for Verifiable Credentials?
