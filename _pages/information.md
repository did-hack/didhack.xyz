- **Teams**: Teams can be created at any time and can range from **1-5 people**. If your team has more than 5 people we cannot guarantee everyone will receive an award.
- **Original Work**: All work submitted must be original, created during the hackathon. Participants should not reuse previously developed projects or substantial portions of code. However, the use of publicly available libraries, frameworks, and APIs is encouraged.
- **Be Respectful**: You know what it means. If the organizers decide you are not following this simple rule, then we hold the right to remove/block you from the Hackathon.

## Submissions and Presentations:

All teams are encouraged to share what they worked on during the hackathon. No project is too unfinished.

### Submissions:
- To be eligible to win you must submit your project by _____ through _____.
- Winning submissions will be clear and concise.
- While not required, any links to source code will help with reviewing submissions.

### Awards:
- To reiterate you **must** submit your project by ___ to be eligible to win through the link above.
- Awards will be different forms of did:hack swag.
- The organizers will contact the winners to get shipment details.

### Presentations:
- If you want to present your project then you must declare by _____ through ____. Depending on the number of submissions we will decide the maximum time per presentation. As a general rule of thumb shoot for 3 minutes.
- Presentations will be occur at: ______.
- Your presentation can either be done live, or be a prerecorded video.

# Project Ideas:

Below are just a few prompts to get you thinking about the space and the problems within. Your projects do not have to satisfy these prompts.

## Start with Use Cases

- Browsing the internet feels anything but private these days due to constant surveillance, data breaches, and lack of control. How can decentralized identity be leveraged to ensure privacy and protect our identities when we’re interacting online?
- More than 1.1 billion people have no official, legally-recognized identity which prevents access to everything from basic services to banking, education, and more. How can decentralized identity technology empower these individuals?
- The metaverse enables new digital experiences that require new ways of using and sharing our digital identities. How can we leverage decentralized identity technology to enhance how we interact in the metaverse?


## Start with Features

- How would you create a new digital identity for the future that is shareable and private?
- What is the best way to render a Verifiable Credential in a product considering both technical requirements and user experience?
- How can biometrics be incorporated into the issuance and/or verification process for Verifiable Credentials?


# FAQ
### Does my project need to be open source to be eligible for submission?
Not at all. With the caveat that you will still need to submit something to win.


<!-- # Guidelines

Work together to create innovative solutions for decentralized identity technology. Each track has example prompts that could be used for building a solution. You are only expected to select one of the prompts below. All of the tracks will be judged equally. Collaborating in teams is highly encouraged!


## Track 1 - Use Cases

- Browsing the internet feels anything but private these days due to constant surveillance, data breaches, and lack of control. How can decentralized identity be leveraged to ensure privacy and protect our identities when we’re interacting online?
- More than 1.1 billion people have no official, legally-recognized identity which prevents access to everything from basic services to banking, education, and more. How can decentralized identity technology empower these individuals?
- The metaverse enables new digital experiences that require new ways of using and sharing our digital identities. How can we leverage decentralized identity technology to enhance how we interact in the metaverse?


## Track 2 - Features

- How would you create a new digital identity for the future that is shareable and private?
- What is the best way to render a Verifiable Credential in a product considering both technical requirements and user experience?
- How can biometrics be incorporated into the issuance and/or verification process for Verifiable Credentials?


## Track 3 - Choose your own adventure
- Create something new, interesting, and/or provoking that embraces decentralized identity!

<br/>

# Deliverables

Submissions and demos can be shared in the following ways:
- Mockups
- Wireframes
- Technical Proof of Concept
- Powerpoint presentation

<br/>

# Submission deadline

for example: teams should post to the Submissions Discord channel by {date, time} to be considered. Each submission should include:
- Team name
- Team participants
- Solution description

<br/>

# Demos

for example: teams should prepare a 2-3 minute presentation to be shared during the closing ceremony, judges may ask questions as part of the demonstration

<br/>

# Judging Criteria

**Fundamentals** - How well does the solution consider and showcase concepts core to decentralized identity?

**Functionality** - Is this a solution that can be realistically implemented? To what extent has the team attempted to demonstrate functionality?

**Usefulness** - Is the solution practical and useful? Does the solution consider real-world adoption?

**Creativity** - How innovative is the solution? -->
