Join us online for `did:hack`, a decentralized identity hackathon!
Our opening event is June 5th. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to work on projects throughout the week with our closing event on June 8th.

Beginner to Decentralized Identity? Donâ€™t worry! Weâ€™ll start the event with an introduction on concepts such as DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and what it means to own and control your own digital identity.

## ðŸŽ‰ What this hackathon is about

`did:hack` is an open event for people to learn, collaborate, and think creatively about how decentralized identity technology can be leveraged to improve digital interactions in the future.

This event is designed to be inclusive to individuals from all backgrounds no matter their technical skills, professional experience or familiarity with decentralized identity.

## Goals for this event:

- Bring the community together
- Build something together
- Spread awareness and grow adoption of decentralized identity (DIDs, VCs, etc.)
- Have an opportunity to learn / experience
- Contribute to open source
